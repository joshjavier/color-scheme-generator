## My process

### Useful resources

- [Cards](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/) - This is a gift that keeps on giving. Whenever I find myself creating some sort of card element, I'd always refer to this article for best practices. The pseudo-content trick and progressive enhancement concepts greatly influenced my implementation for the card strips on this project.

## Acknowledgments

Shout out to Thalita for validating my assumptions and pointing me in the right direction re: a bug in Scrimba that prevents the button click from being triggered.
